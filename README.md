Some notes: 

I added a user photo attribute under the user table and made a migration for this. AJAX was used in multiple areas -- for the shipper's home page (marking items as shipped), creating a new item price (for managers), etc. Made using Materialize CSS Framework. I also incorporated Charts.js and other jQuery features. Best viewed full screen at 90% on Google Chrome.
